Media Player Classic - Home Cinema (MPC-HC) is a free and open source audio
and video player for Windows. MPC-HC is based on the original Guliverkli project
and contains many additional features and bug fixes.

We are in dire need of new developers of any kind. If you can code a little,
or you can create logos for the player and images for the file associations,
or you can create/maintain the main website, please join our IRC channel
and talk to us. Find some easy ticket on our trac page, fix the problem,
post the patch on trac or come on IRC and we'll review it for you.
Any help is always appreciated.

We care about keeping an open project open and free for contributions
wherever they may come from.
