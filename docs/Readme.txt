Media Player Classic - Home Cinema (MPC-HC) is a free and open-source (OSS) video
and audio player for Windows. MPC-HC is based on the original Guliverkli project
and contains many additional features and bug fixes.

We are in dire need of new developers of any kind. If you can code a little, or you can create
logos for the player and images for the file associations, or you can create/maintain the main
website, please join our IRC channel and talk to us. Any help is always appreciated.

Find some easy ticket on our Trac, fix the problem, send a pull request,
or post the patch on Trac or come on IRC and we'll review it for you.
See CONTRIBUTING.md for more info.
