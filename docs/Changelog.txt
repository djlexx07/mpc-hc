1.7.0 - not released yet
========================
+ Replace the internal filters with LAV Filters.
  LAV Filters are modern open source DirectShow filters based on FFmpeg. They are known to be
  reliable and fast and overall should be more stable than the old filters.
  MPC-HC integrates LAV Filters directly and no extra installation steps are required. The embedded
  version of LAV Filters doesn't interact at all with other installed DirectShow filters (including
  standalone versions of LAV Filters).
  Note to XP users: hardware decoding is only supported on nVidia graphic adapters. If you
  really need a DXVA decoder, you can use a standalone version of MPC Video Decoder.
+ Support loading HTTP/RTSP/UDP/RTP streams using embedded source filters
+ D3DFullscreen can now switch to windowed mode (just like regular fullscreen mode)
+ Ticket #533, Add a command line switch (/device) to open the default video device
* D3DFullscreen changes:
  - toggle hotkey is now disabled by default
  - support for madVR has been removed (it already has exclusive mode)
  - 10-bit RBG output now falls back to 8-bit output if the display does not support it
* Updated Basque, German, Greek, Romanian and Slovak translations
* Updated Little CMS to v2.5 (git 3d38474)
* Updated Unrar to v5.0.7
* Updated MediaInfoLib to v0.7.64
* Updated ZenLib to v0.4.29 r444
* Remove D2VSource. It's unmaintained and basically unused.
! D3DFullscreen fixes:
  - fixed strange focus behaviour when always on top is enabled
  - fixed VMR9 D3DFS minimizing when losing focus
  - fixed thumb mouse buttons no working when D3DFS has focus
! Various fixes for better playlist support
! Ticket #2109, #2975, Fix the handling of aspect ratio changes when using EVR-CP or Sync Renderer
  with DXVA decoding
