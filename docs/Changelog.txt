  always open a new instance of MPC-HC in this case. This avoids interrupting the scan accidentally
  and fixes the issues which used to arise when doing that
! Ticket #5130, Remove the information corresponding to the previously playing channel during the DVB scan
! Ticket #5131, DVD playback could stutter on some systems
