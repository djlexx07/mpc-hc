    - LAV Video Decoder: Add a basic H264 MVC decoder based on Intel MediaSDK.
      Note that for now the Intel MediaSDK library is not distributed with MPC-HC.
      If you want to use this new decoder, you have to download the library
       - 32-bit: http://files.1f0.de/lavf/plugins/libmfxsw32-v1.7z
       - 64-bit: http://files.1f0.de/lavf/plugins/libmfxsw64-v1.7z
      and decompress it to the LAVFilters(64) folder.

    - Ticket #5666, LAV Video Decoder: YADIF deinterlacing sometimes caused black screen in DVD menus
    - LAV Audio Decoder: Fix a possible crash when using bitstreaming
* Old DirectX 7 renderers have been removed. Settings will be updated automatically to use the corresponding VMR-9 renderers.
  If you really want to use a renderer similar to VMR-7 (windowed), use Overlay mixer or the "system default" renderer
* Make Video Renderer statistics scalable to window size and unify graph look for EVR Sync and other renderers
* "Replace currently loaded subtitles" option no longer removes subtitles provided by splitter

    - PnS Rotate Y- now flips horizontally

    - PnS Rotate Z- now rotates 90 degrees (counter-clockwise)
    - The postive rotate functions still do 1 degree rotation around their axis
* Hide the infobar in normal view preset. This makes it equal to default view
