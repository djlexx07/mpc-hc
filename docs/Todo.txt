Patches are always welcome. :)

MPC-HC:
1) Try to fix all /W3 warnings for Win32 in our code
2) Fix all coverity scan issues for our code
3) Run /analyze and fix some of the errors; memory leaks, NULL pointer dereferencing,
   buffer overruns etc
4) Remove support for unneeded/obsolete renderers
6) Replace the default old looking toolbar with a more modern one

MPCIconLib:
1) Replace the file association icons with better looking ones

WebServer:
1) Update the images for player.html using a css sprite

Installer:
1) Add file association tasks, see https://trac.mpc-hc.org/ticket/2207

VSFilter:
1) Use the defines from version.h for MPC_COPYRIGHT_STR in VSFilter
2) Define VSFilter's version numbers in a place accessible by its installer and VSFilter itself
3) Backport a few useful patches from those VSFilter forks;  we need individual patches for that
   and we have to make sure that everything works right for mpc-hc itself
