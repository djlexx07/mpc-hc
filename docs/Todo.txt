Patches are always welcome. :)

MPC-HC:
1) Try to fix all /W3 warnings for Win32 in our code
2) Run /analyze and fix some of the errors; memory leaks, NULL pointer dereferencing, buffer overruns etc
3) Remove support for unneeded/obsolete renderers
4) Update Bento4 library or see if we can use ffmpeg for this job
5) Replace the default old looking toolbar with a more modern one
6) MSVC 2012:
   - Subtitles don't show with Release x64 builds, which is worked around by using /Os for
     the SubPic project
   - Merge build_vs2012.bat into build.bat
7) Add FFmpeg as submodule

MPCIconLib:
1) Replace the file association icons with better looking ones

WebServer:
1) Update the images for player.html using css sprite
2) Switch to html5
3) player.html: with IE 9 things don't look the same as Firefox; the volume slider
   is out of bounds, the status and title text are not aligned to the left

FFmpeg:
1) Use ffmpeg for:
   * MPEG-1 and MPEG-2 decoding (this would remove the dependency on libmpeg2)
   * FLAC decoding (this would remove the dependency on libflac, but FLACSource is using it too)
Alternatively, drop all internal decoders and filters and integrate LAVFilters, but keep DXVA1.

Installer:
1) Add file association tasks, see https://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/mpc-hc/ticket/2207

VSFilter:
1) Use the defines from version.h for MPC_COPYRIGHT_STR in VSFilter
2) Define VSFilter's version numbers in a place accessible by its installer and VSFilter itself
3) Do we need the ISOLATION_AWARE_ENABLED define?
4) Backport a few useful patches from those VSFilter forks;  we need individual patches for that
   and we have to make sure that everything works right for mpc-hc itself
